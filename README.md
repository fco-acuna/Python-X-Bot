# selenium-twitter-bot
Selenium based solution for creating a twitter bot. Selenium is a very powerful tool for web automation and scraping. For making Twitter bot, one can use Twitter api, but its paid. This solution on the other hand is not but does require much more work to get things right. 

## Features:
 - Logging into your Twitter account
- Liking tweets of your homepage
- Searching for some keyword or hashtag
- Liking tweets of the search results
- Posting tweets
- Logging out of your account

## Running project locally:

 1. Have `python` environment setup
 2. Clone the repo and go to the cloned directory
 3. Run `pip3 install selenium`
 4. Now you may run any of the given example scripts or write and execute your own scripts 

## Examples:

All the following tasks are completely automated without any manual user input. The script launches Firefox instance and carrys out the tasks provided.
#### Posting Tweets

## Attribution:
This project is inspired from DevEd([@developedbyed](https://twitter.com/developedbyed?lang=en)) tutorial on Twitter automation using Selenium where he explains how to search for a hashtag and like the related posts. For selecting the elements on the page, class attribute is used by him. I built on top of it and added new features such as posting tweets, adding likes to tweets on homepage, search for any keyword and like related posts and logging out. Since Twitter makes use of dynamic classes now, hence the class based selection no longer works. So I made use of other reliable attributes for selecting the elements. Hence the code will work inspite of dynamic classes.

## What's next:
I will be working on adding feature of finding and following new users. Apart from that I will also add features to perform other tasks on tweets such retweeting them.
